a) Implement a plain end2end tensorflow model pipeline with EDA and visualizations etc.,. for this problem - using wide and deep model DNN model and proper feature engineering and preprocessing 
Ensure you train on all the data set (while eda done on 15k samples)

b) Implement the same (a) model using TFX interactivecontext pipeline in a colab
 
c) Implement the solution using pytorch 

d) implement the solution using xgboost
